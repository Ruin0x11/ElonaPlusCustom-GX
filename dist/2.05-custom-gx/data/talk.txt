	/Translation Note/
Text written after %xxx,x,EN will be displayed in the English version of Elona.
See /Vernis for example. The translation doesn't have to be precise.
You can even add your own sentences if you like to. 

You can completely ignore the use of {} when translating. (ie. {だ},{だな} )
Those are structures which are used for some Japanese conversions.
They also convert the code into designated in-game variable. 
The codes are listed below.

{player}	player's name
{aka}		player's nickname(aka)
{nptc}		the name of the person target
{npcc}		the name of the person 
{me}		"I"
{you}		"you"
{objective}	quest:objective
{reward}	quest:reward
{ref}		quest:refer
{map}		quest:map name
{client}	quest:client name


	/Editing Tips/
* When testing, save your game infront of a NPC and use defLoadFolder. setting in the config.txt to quick load/launch the game.


	/Sunstrike/
I have revised the entire text for consistency with the Japanese, and consistency for storyline, names, etc.  More importantly, I have rewritten all the lines to sound more natural and more original.


	/Lord Nightmare's notes/
The default english vernis translations do not completely match the originals, but this seems to be intentional.
Regardless, I've tried my best to make each line correspond 1:1, but I had to add more information to a few of them.
I'm also having trouble translating a few, google's translator is somewhat lousy. Look for the TODO lines.
BMT means 'bad machine translation'
Also I have no idea where the cyber dome line came from, It doesn't seem to appear in the original text, although it does make sense. I left it, but stuck an extra space before it. I also added an alternative to one of the other lines.

Translated ?hiragana? -> english:
VERUNISU		Vernis
Jors/IERUSU		Yerles
EUDANA			Eulderna
RESHIMASU		Lesimas
YOUIN			Yowyn
DULLFY or DARUFI	Derphy
PARUMIA			Palmia
JABI			Xabi
SUTASHA 		Stersha
NOSUTIRISU      	North Tyris
UU			?Ooh?
KURIMUERU		Crim Ale
NEFIA			Nefia
Shin			??? mybe 'new'
Kita			??? maybe 'north'
DANJO			Dungeon
RUMIESUTO		Lumiest
RAHUAERO		Raphael

Note:
The Yowin, Derphy, Palmia, Noyel and Lumiest texts are added from the user created content on the japanese wiki, as are a few random other lines. The original talk.txt doesn't even have the JAPANESE text for those!

Note 2:
I haven't marked the conversation/personality texts as BMT or whatnot.

Note 3: Personality: whoever translated this originally never sorted the translated lines into the subcategories/personalities where they belong.
I did this whenever I could figure out what was supposed to go where. The ones I couldn't figure out I left at the end.

Note 4: I'm not sure whether I should use ... for ellipsis, or the character meant for that, '・.
Special thanks to gridle for helping with a number of the lines which google translate choked on. babelfish isn't much better.

Welcome to Vernis!
The mines around Vernis have brought a lot of money into our small community.  We are thriving thanks to the mines!
Vernis may just be a coal mining town, but we have a long and notable history.
If I were you, I wouldn't dare play the piano in the bar while Loyter is hanging out in there.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
We're caught in the crossfire of the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna for some time now.
Rumor has it that something of great value has been found in Lesimas.
It seems there is a way to obtain new skills. See the trainer to the east of the town center.
Be careful about carrying too much stuff.  You should sell off anything you don't actually need.
That weirdo near the graveyard? Don't pay any attention to that bum. He's a hopeless junkie and I'm pretty sure he's an alcoholic too.
Miches is nuts about stuffed animals.  She's completely obsessed with collecting them.
The road to the east leads to the capital city of Palmia.
You could bounce a quarter off of Shena's ass.  How does she stay in such great shape?
We've had a lot of trouble with thieves recently.
The people in that live in the Cyber Dome are so strange.  What a bunch of freaks!
Vernis is the only known source of coal in the entirety of North Tyris.  We're making a killing.
You're going to Palmia?  Just follow the road to the east.
Everyone loves Shena's ass.
Rogue attacks are becoming more frequent these days.

Ah, there's nothing like the salty smell of the sea breeze.
I love to watch the brutal fights in the pet arena.  You have to be careful though, sometimes audience members catch a stray bullet or get hit by careless dragons.  But you know, the risk is part of the thrill.
Raphael is the enemy of all women.
If you want the best training a fighter can have, you should check out the fighter's guild under the arena office.
The price of seafood cargo is very high farther inland.
I wonder how you get into that Pyramid north of town.  I have heard of people trying to go there, but none of them ever come back.
I hear that a lot of the seediest and creepiest people head to Derphy.  I'm not sure where that place is, but we seem to get more than our fair share of thieves and vagabonds, so maybe it's not that far from here.

Arnord doesn't realize that he already died in battle...
The tavern here was built on top of a graveyard.

This village is called Yowyn. 
The horses sold here are the finest in the land.
We always seem to be short-handed during the harvest season.  I'm sure everyone in town would be glad to have you lend a hand.
Sometimes we see known outlaws heading to the west after they raid our farms or kill our cattle.  I wonder if something is out there.
Head east out of town, and follow the road north to reach the capital of the Kingdom of Palmia.  Be careful around that old fortress though, it's a strange place.  I've heard sometimes people that go near that place are gunned down by ancient machines that survived from Eyth Terre.
The elder always talks about an old run down castle to the southwest.  That old bag is always making up crazy stories.
Yowyn's economy is pretty small, but we do make excellent caskets.  Sometimes the nobles from Palmia send their squires and servants down here to buy them.
The air is so fresh and lively here in the countryside.  I wouldn't give this up for anything.

Noel is crazy.  She'd bite the head off of a kitten if she had the chance.  She kills things and spreads chaos for the hell of it.  I don't mind a thief, but she's a bit over the top.
A lot of thieves hang out here.  They have a hideout under the casino but they won't just let you in.
Slavery is a very lucrative business.  Many people claim it's evil, but even mighty Palmia's economy would disintegrate if they didn't have any slaves to work their fields.
Nothing beats a bloody match at the arena.  If you want to impress the crowd then give them lots of drama and blood.
Derphy has no city guards, so we can do whatever we want!

I can't make out anything that Mia says.
Welcome to the capital of Palmia!  Our kingdom is old and very prosperous.
King Xabi and Queen Stersha are a beautiful couple.
One of our special products here are toys that the nobility often buy for their children.  There are machines in the center of town that sell them, if you can get some coins maybe you can get some awesome toys out of them too.
The etherwinds have been getting strong and more dangerous over the last fifty years.  My grandfather always tells me about how weak they used to be.  If they grow much stronger we might be forced to abandon our homes.
My friend told me there is an ancient fortress to the north.  I wonder if that's true.
We have a lot of parties in Palmia.  The nobility will throw money at any excuse for a drunken celebration.

During the Great War between the Gods many of them scattered across this world.
This temple was built as a reminder of the Great War.
After the Great War the Gods' rivalry changed from trying to kill each other, to gathering the most followers.
The surviving Gods of the Great War discussed among themselves and came to various agreements.
Because of the Gods' conflict the mana flow has become unstable and the climate has grown worse. It seems like it's necessary to isolate the continents.
The Gods that were defeated during the Great War had their powers absorbed and were disolved into tiny pieces which turned into roses. What a miserable end.
They say that the volcano to the northwest was created during the battle between the God of Fire and God of Stone.
It seems the surrounding march came to be from water collecting inside a giant crater.
Tezcatlipoca beckoned the Gods at the start of the Great War to come to this world and launched a surprise attack against them.

Were you also guided here by Norne the fairy? What is this... Lost Irva place? What are these ruins?
It's not just the people who are getting summoned. The monsters from the land below are getting transported here too.
It seems like we are on the west end of the floating continent that appeared above Eulderna.
What's going on? Why am I here?
I saw some of the monsters try to fly away and escape. They bounced right off some sort of barrier in the sky.
Looks like there is no lack of Nefia on this continent either.
Most of the people who got transported here live in these ruins.
Tezcatlipoca...? Nobody here a voice or anything like that when they were brought here.
Most of the people who were summoned here are mercenaries, traveling merchants, and adventurers. That healer over there and the guild members are probably the only exceptions.

This floating continent... our countrymen find it fascinating, yet so unsettling at the same time.
The scholars who went to investigate the hills in the north have yet to return. They're probably monster food by now.
Just who in the world is that attendant? She mowed through the monsters as if they were nothing.
Seems like there's no shortage of Nefia on this continent either.
It is said that Raizel demolished an enemy country all by himself when he was younger.
According to our research, the species of flora and fauna on this continent are exactly the same as the ones in the land below.

There are stories of people who left the mountain a long time ago. Something about a dispute about how we should interact with people from the outside.

There are many Gods of old who lost their divinity in the wars they waged against each other. They fell and became monsters.
Tezcatlipoca was the trigger for the Great War between the Gods. It is said that he alone massacred thousands of Gods in that battle.
It is said that Lost Irva was originally a part of the rest of Irva.
According to legend, the God of Chaos and his servants are sealed deep within the Cradle of Chaos.
The final battle with the God of Chaos was fierce battle; one that we barely won. If he awakens again, the Gods of today who are few in number will surely be unable to stand against him.
The Gods are affected by the prosperity and decline of every age, as it is from the peoples' faith that They derive Their power.
You may find this hard to believe, but it seems like there are people receive guidance from beings in another realm. These people are unbound by logic and the laws of the world.
Offerings are the medium through which the faith of believers is carried to the eight Gods.
Even those who live in this land don't know much about the Gods. The pact of the Eternal League suppresses any information about Them.
