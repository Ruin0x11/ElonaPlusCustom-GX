Beginner's Guide
	Author: An Old Adventurer

<This book is weathered and yellow
with age>
	
I leave this book here in the off
chance that should I not survive my
final adventure, others may learn
from my trials and tribulations.

I have lived many years and have
done many deeds. I have seen much
what this world has to offer.

This cave has been my hideaway in the
last few seasons, though if you are
reading this, it is most likely now
yours to reside in. I don't mind as
I'm either dead or fabulously rich.

Still, if you are planning on going
into the same trade as I and are not
the local scamps just playing at it,
some advice should be parted to you.

Now where to begin?

I won't know from which way you came
from so it's best to give you the 
local landmarks;

If you follow the trail from here to
the South-East you find Vernis. It's
a mining town, but it should still
have some shops, a tavern and an inn.
You should be able to find some work
there, as well as food, gear, and 
even a friend or two. The innslady I
recall was having some trouble with
local ruffians the last time I was
there. 

East of Vernis is what the locals 
call the "Puppy Cave". It's well...
always changing. A local mage called
it a "Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal
plane", whatever that means. 
If you leave the cave and come back, 
or go up or down floors, it will
change all the creatures, items, 
walls, and exits. You can find quite 
a bit of stuff if you don't mind 
hopping in and out. 

The "Puppy" of this cave is fairly
deep in, and a child in town would
love to get it back, but it kept
getting itself killed when I tried.
It always reappeared on that floor 
when I left and came back, but I 
gave up after a few tries. Maybe
you can do it. Just don't get lost.

Once you are a bit tougher and better
geared, the Gray cave of Lesimas
might be be another good spot. It's
one of the more ancient ruins of
Nefia, and there's bound to be
something interesting in there. If
you ignore the roads, it's almost due
south of this cave.

No doubt all around the land there
will be caves and forests spawning
with loathsome critters. Just don't
go blindly into them, check them out
BEFORE going in. Preparation is a key
difference from a live Adventurer and
a dead one. 
         -== Geography ==-
If you follow the roads from Vernis:
-Port Kapul is to the west. 3-5 days
  Good Business there as it's a port
  Fighters Guild and an Arena
  
-Palmia is to the East. 2-3 days
  Big City, lots to see and do
  King lives here
  Has Arena
  
-Yowyn is to the South-East. 2-3 days
  Farm Town, not a lot to do unless
  you like turnips and Harvesting.
  Note to self: Clean out Yeek's Nest
  AGAIN... worse than rabbits they be
  
-Lumiest is South-East of Palmia
  On an Island
  Lots of mages live there
  
-Derphy is South-west of Vernis
  No roads lead there
  Wretched hive of scum and villainy
  Steer clear of Dragon's Nest!

-Noyel is Far FAR to the east
  Bring a sandwich, it's a long walk
  Snow is slow going
  Don't poke the Fire Giant. Bad juju
  
      -== Work and Jobs ==-
While you may want to go about
slaying dragons and saving damsels,
it's best to start small. Being an
adventurer means you'll do jobs that
no one else wants to do.

Deliveries are a good way to start
out in this business. Example:
     Accept job
  -->GET THE ITEM AT YOUR FEET!<--
     Deliver item to recipient
     Collect reward
Note that forgetting the item to 
deliver is very BAD, but not the end 
of the world. If you are very lucky,
the local shops or fields may have
what you are looking for. They won't
know the difference, trust me. 
Also note how many days you have to
deliver things. Running from Lumiest
to Port Kapul is NOT fun, and you may
simply not be fast enough yet to do
the really high paying ones. 

Hunting can range from easy to very
VERY hard. The money offered is a 
good way to tell how bad it will be.
Be careful doing these, as it takes
just one nasty critter to get you.

Gift getting also ranges from easy
to absurd. Just remember that if you
accept the job, running from town to
home and back takes time, and you may
not have that long to do it.

Cooking requests are only good if you
can cook, have the items, and can
deliver before the food rots. But if
you check out the local bakery before
accepting, you may just be able to
buy what you need before doing the
job.

Harvesting LOOKS easy, but it can be 
very hard. Waste no time, and go as
unburdened as possible. Speed is the
key for these jobs.
Finally, try not to fail a job, it's
a black stain on your record, and too
many of those can get the guards on
you. Use you noggin BEFORE accepting
any job. Can I do it? Will I have the
time? Who gets their kid garbage on
their birthday?

      -== Advice and Tips ==-
And now a few nuggets of wisdom:

-Cargos of food are cheap, and you'll
eat them as you travel overland. But
you cannot eat them inside towns or
dungeons. If you are hungry just exit
the town or dungeon, eat, and enter.

-Be cheap. 'b'ash fruit bearing trees
in towns and fields for fruit, and 
scavenge whatever plantlife you can
outside. That armor is not going to
come to you if you keep eating cakes
and pies. 

-The meat of many monsters is edible.
Women love Putit flesh for what it 
does for their skin. Some isn't so
good for you, but if you're hungry...

-While succulent and tasting of young
pork, the flesh of man should not be
eaten. Only crazy people eat people,
and you aren't crazy are you?

-Innkeepers for coin can feed you
quite nicely. They have beds too.

-Until you can buy/find/steal a bed
for your home, stay at inns when you
are tired. A sleeping bag is a good
idea for deep dungeon trekking.

-Should a pet or ally fall in battle,
most towns have a bartender who can
bring them back for a price.

-Check your 'j'ournal! It has all the
information about quests you are on,
jobs you are doing, events, your own
reputation and bills. Check it often.

-On the subject of bills. When you
become famous enough, you'll get a
salary of money and items twice a
month. The salary will be dropped off
in the chest in your home. However,
with salary also comes taxes. Take 
the bill in hand and cash in pocket 
to the local embassy just north of 
Palmia and pay it there. Don't let 
your bills add up as the taxmen are 
worse than any dragon or demon.

-Should your skills start to plateau,
seek a trainer. There is one in every
town, and will sharpen your existing
skills. They also have skills you do
not yet possess and for a price will
teach you them. Beware though, they
only accept platinum coins, and those
are in short supply these days.

-And finally, beware the weather. Oh,
a little rain may have never killed
anybody, but with heavy rain comes 
lightning that can blind you and the
great thunder which can confuse you.
Try not to get lost while in one.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is
stay in place till your head clears.
Rarely, but with increasing fervor is
the dreaded Etherwind. Beware this.
A friend of mine was stuck outside in
it and could barely be called human
when he finally staggered inside.
When it comes, FIND SHELTER! I cannot
stress this enough. Hide in a cave if
the monsters inside won't tear you to
bits. If you are in a town you are by
no means safe. Run to the innkeeper
and demand Shelter. Wait out the evil
storms, and only after it passes can
you return to your duties.







In closing, I hope this is of some
use to you, and I hope my final
adventure is a good one. Now if you
will excuse me, I have a fort to
conquer. How bad could it be?

Good luck to you and your travels.

Museum Administration Manual Mk.III
Written by Curator Schmidt

So you want to run a Museum do you?

Young Sir/Lady, it takes some hefty
capital to purchase such a deed, but
if you have the time, patience, and
money this old curator will help you
out with this handy, unbiased manual.

In your wanton and overly hedonistic
destruction of the local flora and 
fauna (henceforth known in this guide
as "adventuring") you might have come
across some of the following:

Item a.) Figure of <Fauna>
Item b.) Card   of <Fauna>

If so, then you may have barely given
them a glance before shoving them in
your sack if ill-gotten gains and 
simply gone back to "adventuring".
No doubt you have sold them for more
tankards of ale and legs of mutton,
but the more intelligent among you
might collect them into a pile and 
ponder "Why do monsters have these?"

The answer: Vanity! And Magic!

And it is these things that we shall
profit from. And it's so simple even
an adventurer can do it!

Still, just in case, I have written 
down the exact steps to minimize any
unfortunate mishaps that might arise.

Step 1.) Purchase a deed of a Museum.
   This step is what chokes out the
   small fry from the serious doers.
   
Step 2.) 'r'ecite the deed upon the
   spot on the world you wish your
   museum to be. Let the gnomes do
   the building, it won't take long.

Step 3.) Aesthetically place all the 
   Cards and Figures you have found
   inside the museum. Neatness is a
   virtue, though not necessary.

Step 4.) Profit!

That should do it as far as the basic
setup requires. If you want even more
information about specific queries, 
merely read on to learn more!
      -== Notes and Caveats ==-

Whilst having more than one museum is
certainly possible, only your first
one will make any money. 

Figures are worth more than cards
most times anyway.

Don't pile multiple items upon one
space. It is entirely unprofessional,
and utterly ineffectual.

The mightier the monster, the better
value the card and Figure. Rare are
the Figures with a Name or Title on 
them. These so-called "Unique" 
Figures indeed are best. And in 
order to encourage more museums to 
showcase these, I've set up a trust 
that will reward museums based on the
number of Unique Figures that they
have on display, paid out on the 
first of every month.

Back on the topic, while having a 
dragon's card is nice, having ten 
is just tacky. Variety is key. 
The more duplicates you have,
the less they are worth.

Oh and one more thing... the gnomes
that build your museum have somewhat,
oh, narrow tastes. You may have to 
bring in a <house board> or 
<register> to sculpt it into your 
own grandiose vision.



            -== Errata ==-

Base cost: 		140,000 gp
Maintenance cost:    1500 gp/month
Income per rank:      100 gp/month

**Figures above are approximates only


Happy Curating!

Crimberry Addiction and You	
A Schmidt Education Pamphlet

Every year more and more people are
becoming addicted to the seemingly
harmless Crimberry.

Known by an ancient Nefian dialect as
Kur-amu-beri, which should just go to
show its long and sordid history with
our land and peoples, the Crimberry 
is a strong hallucinogen with many
different applications.

Simply eating a berry can cause the
following symptoms in 15 to 60mins:
- Hallucinations
- Impairment like Drunkenness
- Raving like a loon
- Fever-like motor-control failure.
Crimberries are highly addictive, and
should the addict fail to get his
next "Crim", he will either turn to
other narcotics, or become a threat
to our community.

And of course, no one thinks of the
poor children who get involved in our
seemingly "adult" activities. They've
even created a new way to "enjoy" the
devilish berries; 

They copy the wild yeeks and dry them
then shove the dried berry up their
nose. This "snorting" of Crimberries
will lead to the proliferation of 
excess aggression, and will lead more
desparate individuals to become known
as "adventurers" commiting insane
deeds to get their next fix.
While some of the older, long haired
Wizards demand that Crimberries remin
legalized, if only for their sacred
"rituals", this must stop!

        FOR OUR CHILDREN!
        
        FOR OUR FUTURE!

Blessed Herbs
Chronicled by Dr. Schmidt, PhDM

* Curaria [KYURARIA AQUIFOLIUM]
Effect is well known and medicinal.
However, the ability of said effects
is based entirely on it's so called
"consecrated" state, which has been 
clinically proven to be a real effect
and not merely a placebo.
Effect: All-around enhancement

* Morgia [MOJIA DIPSACUS PILOSUS]
Massive hormone Stimulant. Increases 
muscle mass, strength and endurance.
Blind-Test subjects received various
"consecrated" state herbs and thusly
received differing returns. This only
goes to prove that Gods do in fact
exist, and that all our science is 
meaningless in their might.
Effect: Strength and Endurance
	enhancement

* Mareilon [MAREIRON DIPSACUS FEROX]
Neuro-Chemical stimulant. Increases
cognitive abilities. Level of effect
entirely on "consecrated" state.
Effect: Mental enhancement

* Spenseweed [SUPENSUUIDO LONGIFOLIA]
All effects as of yet are unknown,
though it has been noted that those
who ingest it seem to be more "aware"
and levels of perception may be up.
More testing is needed to determine
all side effects.
Effect: Perception enhancement 


* Alraunia [ARURONIA MARTYNIA LUTEA]
Hormone-activated. Aphrodisiac. 
Thus extremely popular with the 
locals. Oddly enough, it also appears
to have some ability at improving 
memory. Research still pending grant.
Effect: Memory and Libido
	enhancement

* Stomafilla [SUTOMAFIRIA HYPOGAEA]
Upon contact with the stomach, the
herb expands and fills the cavity,
leading the consumer to feel very 
"bloated". Long term use and the 
nutritional level of the plant has
yet to be verified. There are also
reports of it enhancing the user's
speed, but most sporting competitions
have yet to ban its use.


Effect: Satiety inducer, Speed
	enhancement


As more specimens are brought in and
tested, so shall we update this brief
guide.

Until then,

Shop Owning and Operational manual
Rewritten by Schmidt the Fence

So, you think you can own a shop? I
know, sitting on your arse all day
hawking wares seems easy enough. 

But then riddle me this genius:
If it's so easy, why is there only 
one shop per type in every town?

The answer is simple: 
      Only the strong Survive!
(Well, that and the high taxes...)

Store operation is so difficult, 
only the meanest and cut-throat can
survive in town. You however, have 
an advantage over us town-shops:
     You will be outside!
And while that sounds less than ideal
right now, your monthly payments to
the crown are cut down to a mere
Five Thousand Gold Pieces a Month
(5000gp/Month)
Which is peanuts to what us city
shops have to pay, believe you me.

     -== Setting up a Shop ==-
Step 1.) Buy a deed of a shop.
 (A Mere 200,000gp at a base price.)

Step 2.) 'r'ead the deed aloud on the
spot of the world you would like it
to be built on.

Step 3.) Set up the shop (see below)

Step 4.) Caveat Emptor!

     -== Running your Shop ==-
Your shop is up and now it must be
run, which is a separate process.

First you need a shopkeeper. Now this
cannot be you, as you have to out and
get the things to sell. So you have
to go and get one of your companions
to do it. You should choose a worker
based on how good they look, and how
good a negotiator they are, as they
are the vital two things in any good
sale. 

Now that you have such a goon,
go to the register in the shop.
Assign that person to the job. 

The other part is also simple, to 
SELL Stuff you need to HAVE stuff.
So go get stuff and and leave it in
your shop.




-== Little Golden Nuggets of Info ==-

Your Salesperson stays at the shop
and cannot come with you.

Selling stuff makes money(natch) 
and also raises shop rank.

A higher shop rank brings in
customers with a fatter wallet
ready for you to empty. The pricier
items also won't sell until your
shop is of a higher rank.


The number of customers that will
stop by the shop also depends on
the shop's rank and the 
shopkeeper's Charisma.

How much a customer is willing to
cough up for an item depends on the
shopkeep's Negotiation skill.

The potentials of the shopkeeper's
Negotiation skill and Charisma stat 
can be topped up by spending bronze 
coins at the register.

Investigate your allies to find the
prettiest and bestest negotiator.
It used to cost an arm and a leg, 
but these days it's a mere 100gp.
You young 'uns are lucky.

On days that the shop sells
something, the shopkeeper will earn
experience, which can go towards 
acquiring up to two special 
shopkeeper feats.

That's not all! Rack up YacaPoints
based on how much you sell and how
many customers visit. Spend them
points by using the YacaPoint card,
which every shop should come with
thanks to the agreement with the
Temple of Yacatect.

Due to a vicious spat with the 
local Furniture Union, we cannot 
sell any spare furniture out of 
town. We in town can still buy and
sell it. The same goes for cargo. 
Whatever goes in your cart, 
doesn't go in the shop.

Anything else, garbage, junk, even
rotten stuff can be sold if you can 
find a sucker for it. If it's on
the floor, it'll be fair game to 
the customers.

So if there's some item in the
shop that you don't want customers
to go layin' their paws on, you'll 
want to mark it off as a display
item with a rope divider or glass 
case tile. Those you can find when
redesigning the shop. They're
probably somewhere in the 9th and 
10th rows in the list from the top.

Due to your shop permit, you can
ONLY sell a maximum of 10 items at
a time. You can expand on this for
a mere 2000gp for an additional 
ten slots, and every subsequent
1000gp for each 10 slots after.

	-== Fiscal Information ==-
Base cost:            200,000 gp
Maintenance cost:     5,000 gp/month
Income per rank:      ??? gp/month**

**Why ??? for income? 'Cause that's 
where you come in bub!

With luck, you too will be living
large like me!

Remember: The GP stops here!

Good Business to you!

　自給自足…素敵な響きですね。副業や趣

に、簡単な自家栽培の方法を教えましょう。

　まず、なんといっても大事なのは植える
時期と場所です。時期は、雨が降っている
時が好ましく、場所はもちろん畑を選ぶべ
きです。雨の日に植えた種は枯れにくく、
畑の土は、収穫した種が新しく芽を残す可
能性を増加させます。

　種を無事に植えたら、成長を見守りまし

さないでください。

　最後は待望の収穫です。うん、その前に
一度実の成った種は枯れることがないとい
うことを覚えておいたほうがいいですね。
収穫できるものは季節によって変わります。

　収穫は、栽培の腕がもっとも問われる瞬
間です。もしあなたのスキルが相当に高け
れば、収穫した植物がまた新たな芽を残し
てくれるかもしれません。

　コンポストに有機物を置いておくと数日
で肥料に変わります。肥料を使うと植物が
一気に成長するので、枯れるリスクも減り
ます。

　畑には作物管理セットも置いてあります。
これで管理することで、特定の植物だけが

Easy Gardnin'
by Valentina Schmidt

Thinkin' bout growin' yer own food?
Whether yer jist lookin' ta fool 
around with a bit o' herbs or ta 
raise some serious garden stuff 
like I have all my life, ya got the 
right book.

First, ya got ta pick a time an'
place ta plant some seeds. Seeds
are best planted when it's raining
an' on field tiles. Seeds planted 
during rain are gonna wilt less 
often, and those planted on
a field that's found on farms an'
those abandoned ranches will leave 
a new seedling behind more often
after harvest.
Once ya've planted some seeds, it's 
time ta watch em grow. If yer lucky 
an' all goes well, the seed will 
sprout an' grow over the course of 
along half a month ta a month an' 
bear fruit. If yer jist starting 
off an' don't got none of a 
Gardnin' Skill much - then ya'll 
find near all of yer crops wilting 
afore harvest, but don't give up.

Lastly is what I expect is 
ev'rybody's favorite part. 
Harvestin'. But first, know that 
any plant that has fruited ain't 
gonna wilt ever until ya harvest 
it. An' what ya harvest will change 
with the season. Meanin' the same 
plant from the same seed is gonna 
give different things next season.

Harvestin' is where yer skill 
matters the most. If ya got 
a-plenty of it, ya'll find the crop 
leavin' behind a seedlin' after 
harvest more often.

Leave organic stuff on a compost 
fer a few days ta turn it inta 
fertilizer. Use that on yer crops 
an' they'll be done growed up in no 
time at all - aye, an' I really 
mean no time. There won't even be 
time fer em ta wilt.

Ya'll find the crop management tools
on the farm. Use it ta make only
certain types of plants grow, which
will ensure ya harvest only certain
types of items. Try it out yerself
ta see which treatment results in
what crops.

As yer Gardnin' skill increases, 
the quality of fruits an' vegetables
ya harvest will increase. An' that 
also means heapin' gangs of dad-
blasted wild animals are gonna come 
a-visitin' like yeeks to Yowyn, so 
be careful that ya don't git eat 
up. Git em once an' they won't come 
back fer a while though.

There's all sortsa crazy seeds an' 
crops ta be found an' growed in 
Norf Tyris. Good luck with your 
farm, and happy tillin'!



P.S. I've heared tell that ya should
also harvest on a rainy day. Does 
it actually have any effect? My
Pappy said his Pappy's Uncah 
sweared up and down that it does, 
but dogged if I know.

You Water Wasting Jackals! Curse you!
By Schmidt the Water Bandit

Where I come from water is life! 
Waterholes are protected to the death
down to the last woman and child!

I come to this country, and what do I
see? Water, nay, LIFE, being wasted!
You people, who live in such lushes,
waste so much it's sinful!

Water should be blessed, given to all
your gods as tribute! Do you people
even know all the things you can do
with dirty water? 

I suspect not.

Nor will you if you simply toss it 
all away like dung from a diseased
camel.

May all who waste water wither like
grass in a drought, and may what you
issue from your loins be as sand!

Damn you all!

牧畜のすすめ
	written by 牧畜マスター

　ええっと…本を書くのなんて苦手なんだ
けど…印税が欲しいし…ほかにやることも
ないし…

　牧畜か…僕もロマンを求めてこの家業に
ついたけど、はじめの頃は失敗の連続だっ
た。まず第一の難関は、ブリーダーを入手
することだ。ブリーダーって何かって…？
名前の通り、どんどん子供を生む生物のこ
とさ。ブリーダーを登録しておけば、時間
の経過とともに、種は繁栄していくんだ。

　始めの頃は、野生の動物や、にわとりや
羊をお勧めするよ。基本的に野生の動物は
繁殖能力が高いんだ。モンスターは、強力
な生物ほど、繁殖する確率が低くなるみた
いだ。

　家畜は放っておいても勝手に生活するけ
れど、家畜用の餌を食べさせれば太らせる
ことできるよ。１匹に与えるよりも効果は
薄くなるけど、レジスターに餌を撒く機能
もあるから目的に応じて使いわけよう。

あと、定期的にブラッシングしてあげると
健康になって肉質もよくなるんだ。これに
は家畜用の大型ブラシと、撫でまわすため
の技能が必要になるよ。

　特別な性質を持った家畜がたまに増える
こともある。どんな性質を持っているかは
ブラッシングする時に注意して触診すれば
わかるはずさ。家畜の状態なら性質に応じ
て効果を発揮するし、ブリーダーの状態な
ら同系統の性質持ちが増えやすくなる。
　増えたばかりの家畜は小さいので、乳を
飲ませて大きくしよう。育った家畜ほど肉
や乳の品質が良くなるんだ。

　牧場の中はできるだけ綺麗にしておこう。
卵を生んだり、乳を搾る場所が必要だから。
フンは家畜の病気の元なのでこまめに処理
しようね。家畜が病気になるとフンばかり
出すし、他の家畜にも感染させてしまうよ。
病気の予防と治療には消毒が一番だけど、
用意できないなら隔離や処分も考えよう。

それと、あまり家畜の数が多すぎても、繁
殖率や卵や乳を生み出す能力が落ちてしま
うよ。２０匹ぐらいが手ごろな数かな？適
当に間引くようにしたらいい。

　増えてきた家畜をどうするかは、君次第
だ…家畜はいつでも連れ出せるから、奴隷
商人に売り払ってもいいね。従順で友好的
な家畜ほど重宝されるから、コミュニケー
ションはしっかり取ろう。
　生きたまま神に捧げるのもいいね。家畜
は古来から神に人気の供物なんだ。死体と

評価される。
　家畜を殺して肉と皮を剥ぎ取れば中々の
値段になるよ。料理ができなくても日干し

A Ranching guide for the Greenhorns
	3rd Edition
	By Cattle Baron Schmidt

Howdy all! I write this guide for 
the same reason I rustle cattle 
about: Money. Plenty of good 
royalties to be had if one takes 
the time to put pen to paper. 
Still, while I can't give ALL my 
secrets to you as it'd put me out 
of business, but I can't get you to
by my next book if I don't give at
least the basics.

To begin with, you'll at least 
eighty thousand or so to purchase a
deed to a ranch. Less, if you are a
good talker or rather attractive.

Then, with deed in hand, find the 
best place for it you can find.
While it cannot be within town 
limits, as you do NOT want people 
asking nosy questions on what 
exactly it is you are breeding, or
other such moral or ethical-type 
dilemmas.

Once you are at the spot of choice,
merely 'r'ead the deed and claim 
your land.

-== The Joys & Perils of Breeding ==-

Good Breeding is a fine art, and is
what separates us from the savages.
No where more true is this rule 
than at a ranch.

Any animal assigned to be a "breeder"
will stay on the ranch, and, in time,
produce milk, eggs, shit, and other 
bits. And no, I am not going to try 
to explain how mammals will lay eggs 
or how exactly you milk a twenty-ton
firebreathing lizard. I don't rightly
try to answer those sort of questions
and frankly, neither should you. Just
accept the fact and move on.

Now, those items can be sold for fair
coin, but the real profit is in the
breeding and rightly so. This isn't a
farm after all. Now, with the coming 
of the Etherwind, breeding has become
a very simple process. Not like the
old days, when you had to keep track
of bloodlines, and breeding seasons,
and listen to the mating howls, and
the awful thumping of not one but two
Twenty-ton Carnivores going at it.
All. Night. Long.

But I digress. Now all you do is just
assign it breeding duties, and let it
be. Soon, there will be more of them.
Mitosis? Magic? Again these are the
questions you should not rightly ask.

Generally speaking, wild animals -
chickens, sheep, rabbits and the like
- breed like rabbits. Heh. Another
thing to keep in mind is that the
more powerful a monster is, the
slower it'll breed on your ranch.
That's something to remember when
choosing what to breed if you need a
gazillion more of them.

I did say that all you have to do to
get them to breed is to leave them
to their own devices. So feeding them 
is optional - I dunno they probably
eat sunlight or something - but if 
you do give them a livestock feed 
it'll fatten them up. Or you can use 
that register on the ranch to split 
that feed amongst every animal there.
Won't fill them up as much, but gets 
the job done.

If you want to get really good 
quality meat, what you have to do is 
brush them once in a while. Grab a 
big brush, and give them a nice 
rubbing. Of course, you need to know 
how to do the Rub special 'a'ction 
in order for you to do that.

Sometimes you'll manage to breed
one of them farm animals that are
really good at something. I don't
mean maths or anything. They might
be good at putting out oodles and
oodles of milk or eggs. Or maybe
they'll have good meat or skin.
You'll know what they're good or bad
at by paying attention during
brushing. Those qualities will be
exhibited while they're on the
ranch. If they're the breeder, 
they'll produce more animals with 
similar qualities.

Newborns on the ranch will start out
small, so 'T'hrow some milk their way
to make sure they grow up big and
strong. If you do, the meat and milk 
they give will improve.
You'll want to keep the ranch clean.
Ranch animals need space to lay eggs 
and uh... milk themselves. Can't do 
that if there's shit all over the
place, can they?

Leaving their shit around will cause
them to get sick and crap even more. 
It'll also make the other animals 
on the ranch sick. Disinfecting the 
ranch will both prevent that from 
happening AND heal the sick animals. 
But if you can't afford that, then 
you might wanna quarantine or 
cull them.

It's a good idea to keep an eye on
the number of animals on the ranch.
They don't breed as fast and also
produce less milk and eggs when
the ranch is full of animals. I find
20 animals optimal number. See if
you can't find a nice balance for
your ranches too.

    -== Fruits of Your Labour ==-

Now, these... offspring, can be used
in several ways, which I shall list
below:

'i'nteract with it and get it to join
you on your travels.

Gene Engineering with zero risk to 
the originals.

Profit by taking it to a slave 
trader if, I might add, you know 
where to go where no one asks any 
questions. They fetch more if they 
are tame - so you might want to make 
sure they're servile and have a 
decent bond with you.

Or you can kill it and the odds of 
a carcass being salvageable are 
much better than duking it out in 
the wild.

Sacrifice it alive to your God - a 
favourite of the Gods since time
immemorial. Unlike offering pieces 
of a corpse on an altar, weight 
won't matter here. Instead, it's 
apparently scored based on the its 
bond with you and the quality of 
its meat.


As a side note, sometimes the ranch
animals get a little antsy when one 
of them is killed. Just pop out of 
the ranch and come back, and you'll 
find that they have settled down.

-== The Drydock. Waste Nothing ==-

A benefit of having a ranch is having
a drydock at your disposal. Now I put
mine in the southeast corner so the 
wind will blow the stench away from
my estate. I assume it will be the 
same for you (you'd best hope so).
In any other trade a rotten carcass
would be nothing but a loss.




Not so with a ranch, where nothing 
goes to waste. Simply dump your 
rotten meat into the drydock to 
cure, and in no time at all you'll 
have delicious, lightweight, 
adventurer-sought-after Jerky!

	-== In Conclusion ==-

At this point a wise man would stop
writing here, and just let you dream.
Simply imagine the possibilities, and
then grasp them.

In my next book, which will be soon
available, I will highlight the more
subtle tricks to the trade, like how
exactly you prevent a twenty-ton, 
fire-breathing, living force of
Destruction and Death from simply
leaving the ranch after setting all
to the flame and devouring you on the
spot for asking it to sit there and
breed.

Until then Partners!

You have been cordially invited hero,
RSVP not required, but come prepared.

<This has been written on papyrus>

You have gotten a bit of a name for 
yourself young one, and you are even
now growing stronger. Soon I, in my
age beyond ages, might not be a match
for you. And sensibly, I won't take
that risk later. But I do so love a 
fresh challenge every now and then. 

So hear this.

Seek my Pyramid! Challenge my maze!

Of course you should have a reason
more than simply my word of challenge.

How about treasure? Ah, I knew that 
would do it. Within my Labyrinth lies
much treasure if you can find it. It
lies within much risk, but any reward
without risk is hollow and cold as is.

And there is what I carry as well, 
though I feel it fair to warn you
that I have played this game for a
long, long time and have yet to lose.

Oh and one more thing, should you not
be properly entered within the great 
Book of the Dead before entering, 
those within shall ensure that you
become so, promptly indeed.

Face me if you dare!

I saw the town get turned into a 
smouldering pile of rubble. I was
hoping for just one more chance.
Fact is, I didn't get it. Because
over and over again she fought lions,
refusing to die. Look, her rib cage's
still intact and everything. Didn't
eat into it at all. Good as new.
Crazy stuff, if you ask me. Now, you
receive four options. First is 
especially attractive and will not
try to kill you. Next up, stunning...
character to go with her looks. Third
has a habit of lazing around. Lastly,
a loyal mage who will go walk over
red-hot embers for you. I wish I were
anywhere but here. Actually, I
CAN run away. RIGHT NOW. Alright,
time to haul butt. You guys aren't
ever taking me alive. I'm gonna keep
running. Over and out.
















10 thousand gp. More than enough to
wash away everything. I want to
forget these memories that are still
raw. Seems like it was just the
other day when it happened. But as
much I would like to forget, I can't.
Could I have stopped everything that
happened? She's never coming back
anyway. I would have gone insane
over the sight of people bleeding,
scratching their faces off. Flecks of
skin flying. It was quite the
headache for everyone in town, from
royalty to the peasants. Now
if only aliens were violent tourist
neighbours, storing shapeshifting

ネフィア症候群
	written by ザナン精神科医

　ネフィア症候群とは、ネフィア内で発症
することがある一種の精神障害である。

・症状
　大きく３つの進行段階が存在し、後の物
ほど重篤になりやすい。


ステージ１
　判断力が低下する。
　低下具合は個人差があるものの、一般的
に、落ちている有益な道具を無視する、
多数の敵の中に飛び込む、といった行動
をとるようになる。と言っても、街での
日常生活には支障がないレベルであり、
この状態で活動する冒険者も多い。

ステージ２
　認識力が低下し、一部のオブジェクト
に至っては完全に視認できなくなる。
　階段を認識できなくなることが多く、
その場合ネフィアから自力で家へ帰ること
が非常に困難になる。

ステージ３
　攻撃性が増幅される。
　この段階になると同族だろうと元仲間
だろうと積極的に攻撃するようになる。
　原理は不明であるが、ステージ３同士で
戦うことは基本的にない。
　発症した者同士で群れを形成することも
あるため、お互いを認識できないわけでは
ないようだ。
　元から攻撃性が極めて低い者はこの段階に
達しても変化がみられない。


　ステージ２以降の者はネフィア内を徘徊し
続け、いずれネフィアとともに地殻に沈む
ことになるが、徘徊している間に偶然外に
出てしまうことも少なくない。

・原因など
　ネフィアの持つ魔力を原因とする説、
特殊な磁場を原因とする説、の二つが有力
だが、明確な結論は出ていない。
　長居すればするほど症状が悪化する傾向に
あるが、個人差が非常に大きい。
　特に冒険者と呼ばれる者たちは発症しても
ステージ１どまりのことが多く、そもそも
発症しない者も多数である。
　というより、重篤化しない体質の者だけが
冒険者として活動できていると言ったほう
が正しい。

・対策について
　治療法は確立されていない。
　しかし、耐性のある体質の者が仲間に
いると他の者も発症しにくいという研究
データがある。
　また、統率者を失った部隊が集団で発症
した例もあり、精神的な要の有無が大きい
とされる。
　一度発症してもネフィアを離れることで
症状が改善するケースもある。

・一般認識
　ネフィアが危険であることは古代から
広く知られているが、理由としてこの症候群
の存在を挙げられる者は少ない。
　ネフィアに棲息するモンスターさえ処理
できれば何も危険はないという誤解も多く、
侵入した腕自慢が発症してしまうケースが
昔から後を絶たない（＊１）。
　一部の国では立ち入りを法で禁じたり、
軍が管理を行うなどの対策が取られている
がまだまだ不十分である。















＊１

A Review on Nefian Psychosis
	by a Zanan Psychologist

Nefian Psychosis is a mental disorder
that develops in some people when
they are within a Nefia (commonly
known as a dungeon).

       -=Signs and symptoms=-
The disorder presents itself in three
stages, each of which are described
below, with the latter stages being
more serious.

       -=Stage 1 psychosis=-
Characterized by lowered cognitive
ability. The decrease in cognitive
ability varies between patients, but
they will typically be lacking in
their object recognition ability and
ignore useful items on the ground or
charge blindly into enemies.

Nevertheless, many adventurers are
able to maintain a high quality of
life in towns while afflicted with
this stage of the disorder.

       -=Stage 2 psychosis=-
Extremely low object recognition
ability, with a complete inability
to recognize some classes of objects.
Many afflicted by this stage of the
disorder are unable to recognize
staircases, and experience great
difficulty in finding their way home.




       -=Stage 3 psychosis=-
Marked by increased aggressiveness.
At this stage, patients actively
target and exhibit aggression towards
other people, including acquaintances
and former allies. For reasons yet
unknown, Stage 3 patients do not
attack one another.

Some of the afflicted band together
to form working groups, so it appears
that they are somehow able to
recognize one another. It has also
been observed that individuals who
displayed no aggressive behaviour
before the onset of the disorder do
not display any aggression whatsoever
even at this stage.

Many individuals suffering from Stage
2 psychosis may get trapped in
dungeons, but there are many reports
of such individuals suddenly
reappearing aboveground when the
dungeon sinks into the crust.

          -=Hypothesis=-
Two hypotheses have offered to
explain this phenomenon, namely that
it results either from exposure to
mana in dungeons or to a particular
type of magnetic field. Neither of
these explanations, however, have
proved to be completely satisfactory.
Though is indeed a strong and
positive correlation between the
amount of time spent in dungeons and
the severity of psychosis, it does
not account for the high variability
in the speed and severity of onset of
psychosis between individuals.

Many afflicted adventurers also never
progress beyond Stage 1, and many
more never develop psychosis at all.
It is possible that individuals who
become adventurers are inherently less
likely to be predisposed to the
disorder.

 -=Prevention of Nefian Psychosis=-
There is no cure for Nefian Psychosis
at the time of writing. However,
research has shown that recruiting
allies who are not predisposed to
psychosis can offer some protection
against the disorder. There has also
been a case where an entire group of
individuals developed the disorder
after losing their commander, so it
is commonly thought that mood and
the mental state of individuals
play an important part in both
the progression and prevention of
the disorder.

Some individuals also experience an
improvement in their condition after
avoiding dungeons for a period of
time.

       -=Public perception=-
The notion that dungeons are
dangerous is well-entrenched in
society since ancient times, but few
will associate Nefian Psychosis
with that danger. It is a common
misconception that dungeons are
innocuous without the monsters that
reside within them, as there have
been many documented cases of
skilled dungeon-delvers coming down
with the disorder since ancient
times (see footnote 1).
 
For that reason, some countries
forbid entrance to dungeons while
others limit dungeon access to
the military, but these measures
still fall short of preventing
cases of Nefian Psychosis.









Footnote 1:
The earliest record of such a case
was an inscription discovered in
Kjaraht, dating back to 3000 years
ago. A well-known dungeon conquerer
became deranged and it was suspected
that he was possessed by a dungeon,
leading to his eventual execution.

Gifting Gifts
	by a Travelling Merchant

What is it that you do when you would
like to give someone a gift? Do you
sometimes get lazy and give it to
them by hand instead of placing it
at their feet?

If it's for someone close like a Soul
Mate, or if you are in a terrible
hurry, then that's fair enough.
However, many of the elderly find it
rather offensive to be handed items.

It is polite to place items at
peoples' feet in most areas. Of
course, you don't have to go that far
for your family members.

One thing you should keep in mind is
that it is rude to place items at
peoples' feet in parts of the
Asserian continent. When visiting
these areas, you must not get angry
when strangers pass items to you by
hand.

Like they say, when in Palmia, do as
the Palmians do. Remember, always
read up on the culture before
visiting a place!

An Exercise in Team-Building
	by Lead Instructor

For today's practice, you will be
pairing up with someone else to form
a tag team.

Now grab a buddy. The one on the left
will be in charge of movement.

If you're fighting a battle in a tag
team, watch how your partner moves.
If you're fighting someone strong,
pay special attention to how you move
during the fight, and I guarantee
you'll learn lots from it.

When taking fire, whoever has the
most health at that moment should
take damage for the other. And don't
forget! Split any gold you pick up
with your partner.

Walk at the same speed to make sure
you don't trip. You there, you don't
have to tie your legs together! Put
that rope away.

What? You don't have a partner?
Alright, you can tag with me.

Adventurers Quarterly (Spring 518)
	by Edelia the maid, age 12

Hello there. I am Edelia the maid.
How do you do? Today I bring to you
advice that will hopefully prove to be
of use in your adventures.

There are many types of furniture
that are indispensable to every
home. No home should be without beds,
cooking utensils, and storage
containers.

Some furniture like bookshelves can
be used as a (t)ool. Yet others -
fridges for example - are storage
containers that can be (o)pened.
These will prove useful in keeping
your home clutter-free.

Before buying a new deed and moving
house for a change of pace, how about
looking over your house and seeing
if you can't sort things out?

Bitter Last Words
	of a Zanan Researcher

The chief called me in today. Turns
out I'm going to be transferred to
another research facility. Why?
We're so close to perfecting our
weaponized insects! I may be low on
the management hierarchy, but I'm
still the one in charge of my team.
We're not going to have enough
people here if I get transferred.
What's worse is that this facility
I'm going to is conducting research
on bacterial human augmentation.
That term itself gives me the chills.

This is an order so I can't just say
no to it, but it really pisses me
off how they made that decision
without consulting me. And now
they mention it to me in passing
as if it were no big deal.

Damn it.















        -------------------

The people at this new facility are
crazy. And considering where I used
to work, that's saying a lot. I
wondered where they were getting
their subjects from. Turns out they
swindled money from people, then
forced them to sell their family
members when they couldn't pay up.

I can't believe that they're
experimenting on kids too.

Damn these people.

How do I know this? Because the
chief was so happy after counting
the gold he had siphoned off of
families that he just had to tell me
about it. Can you believe that? I'm
seriously thinking of defecting to
another country, because there is
no way I want to work here.

I can't escape though. The armed
guards are always watching. They
call it the biohazard containment
protocol, and it's so strict that
not even an ant could get out from
here. I'd have to overpower the
guards somehow or punch a hole in
the wall in order to get out...







        -------------------

The subjects are referred to by
numbers, held in single cells (which
they call "Suites"), and are kept
under constant surveillance. They're
prisoners, guilty of nothing except
for the sin of falling for a scam.

I told that to a co-worker of mine,
and he said that it's their fault
for falling for it. He seriously
said that.

To top it off, they just stuck
inspection duty on me. Saying that
I could go chat with them if I
liked them so much.

Damn these people.
        -------------------

So I sucked it up and did the
inspection rounds. The subjects
cussed at me the moment they saw me.
I didn't do anything to them, but I
guess I'm the enemy from their
perspective. So much for chatting
with them, huh. While heading back,
I heard someone sobbing in the cell
at the end of the corridor and what
sounded like someone else trying to
console the person who was crying.
I did hear something about a pair
of siblings - brother and sister to
be exact - having their cells next
to each other.



It's heartbreaking, but I can't
possibly tell anyone or do anything
about that. I'm such a coward.

Damn myself.















        -------------------

You have got to be kidding me. They
are trying to control human-meshera
homunculi here! I mean, it
technically IS bacteria, but it's
completely different from what the
reports we're sending to the
military say!

They tried to research meshera once
but the plug got pulled on it. The
fact that they're doing it in secret
now must mean they're be looking to
find results important enough to
make the military shut up.

There's probably more to this. I'm
going to keep looking.

        -------------------

Seems like they plan on controlling
the meshera with altered nerve
fibres. They expose the body to
meshera and allow it to transform,
then use it like a puppet when it's
done.

The bacteria assumes motor control
and attempts to move the body when
it invades the nerves, and they
prevent that with drugs and surgical
intervention. They have already
completed the surgery on every
subject here.

This works in theory, but what if
the subjects go out of control
after the procedure is done? Turns
out the subjects get culled with gas
after the procedure. They're going
to use this on soldiers only after
they get the technique right.

Damn it. This is unforgivable.














        -------------------

Everybody is running around with
their hair on fire today. I heard
the big shots from the military's
HQ are inspecting this place in the
afternoon. They must be really
desperate to hide everything,
because even a newcomer like me got
roped in to help cover up. And
thanks to that, I now know just how
far they went in their research.
Damn this place to hell. The stuff
they do here is so sickening that I
feel like throwing up. This research
is off the deep end.

I've memorized the documents I saw
today.

        -------------------

The person who came to inspect
turned out to be a subordinate of
the Crimson Hero. The Crimson of
Zanan is quite famous as a military
man, but in the research circles he's
famous for his mistrust of biological
weapons. He's the very same person
who cut my insect research budget
down to nothing.

Anyway. This is my chance to make
this hellhole disappear! I scribbled
down everything I knew about this
place on to a piece of paper and
managed to slip it to the inspector
as he was leaving.


Guess this is what they call
whistleblowing. This is all I can
do. I've been cooped up in this
place ever since I got here. Time to
pray that they don't find out I was
the one to report it, and that they
get here before the subjects get
sacrificed...












        -------------------

This is bad. The chief must feel
that something is wrong with
upcoming inspection, because he
pushed the experiment forward. Damn,
they're already calling me, telling
me to get ready to start the
experiment. I have to do something!











        -------------------

I couldn't do anything. Didn't have
time to do anything. Could only
follow orders. After the subjects'
meshera was activated, we
administered the drugs.

The drugs were unfortunately not
potent enough to turn people into
vegetables, and all of them started
writhing in pain. Or it could have
been due to the meshera. I don't
know.

All the other researchers looked at
the writhing subjects expectantly.
It's probably not my place to say
this because I'm a weapons
researcher, but their indifference
pisses me off.

Damn these people. Damn them all.

















        -------------------

Two hours after the experiment began,
the changes began to show. Some of
subjects' bodies began to change
colour while others grew tentacles.
The chief called them "low-
compatibility trash". Well guess
what, you're the ones who are trash.
While all other subjects were
convulsing, Subject #14 just keeled
over and stopped moving. His body
remained unchanged so they assumed
he was compatible, but something
seemed off to me. He was wheeled
off into another room for further
examination. Alright, I gotta go too.



        -------------------

The moment we carried him into
another room, Subject #14 leapt up.
Seems like he was just playing dead.
Oldest trick in the book, but it
sure was effective.

With his superhuman strength, he
tossed the guards away as if they
were rag dolls, and his wound healed
instantaneously.

Could he be strong enough to force
his way out of this compound? I
shouted at the guards and told
them to guard the door, pointing
at the exit.

It seemed like #14 understood,
because he made a beeline towards
the exit while mowing down the guards
on his way out. Alright.

















        -------------------

Damn it, I'm an idiot! He could've
cleaned out the entire complex by
himself if he was that strong!

#14 had evaded his pursuers, but the
security alarm has been set off.
Rescuing #16 - his sister - is going
to be a lot more difficult now.

Why did I not thing of this? Damn
it, I'm such an idiot!







        -------------------

People disgust me. I'm sick and
tired of everything.

It's been 12 hours since the
experiment. Some people including
myself were sent off to look to see
if there were any other compatible
subjects.

My head was filled with thoughts of
how I was going to escape from the
quarantine facility if there was
another compatible subject there.
Before I knew it, I had already
arrived at the suites, and I was not
prepared for what I saw there.


The subjects' bodies had transformed
into cocoons. The other researchers
were shouting something. That this
was too fast and that they shouldn't
be transforming in a mere 12 hours.

They frantically tried to contact
those outside on the comms, but then
there was a loud noise. It was the
sound of the containment barriers
closing around the quarantine
facility. The researcher standing
right at the back of the group ran
to try to get out, but the walls
were already down.

The comms was silent.



        -------------------

While we despaired, the cocoons
started assaulting us with
tentacles. We managed to retreat all
the way to the containment wall
though pretty much everyone had
sustained serious injuries. We are
trapped here. There is no way out.

We heard a loud noise deep in the
facility. Was it another subject on
a rampage, striking the walls? I was
curious, but with the tentacles
trapping us here, there was no way I
would ever be able to make it there
to find out.

Some of the researchers have lost
their minds and are laughing, and
the others have barricaded
themselves in a corner. Me? I'm
writing this.

















        -------------------

Damn it, they're gassing us all

First off is "Onslaught". It means
search and destroy. When I give
this order, everyone of you should
keep moving while searching for
enemies. Destroy every enemy that
you come across. Be on the offensive
and pursue your targets. Use
everything you got, and leave no
enemy standing. 

Next is "Defense". Do not attack.
Under no circumstances will any of
you engage the enemy when this
Directive is given. Watch for enemy
movements, and sabotage or distract
the enemy when you can, but hold
your fire. If you are under fire,
hold your position the best you can,
and wait for further orders.

Third is "Intercept". Engage
only enemies that are close by. Any
skirmishes must be within range of
the commander. If I don't see the
enemy, neither do you. Is that clear?
Do not over-extend. Conserve your
resources and wait for new orders.
Do not pursue any enemy out of range.

Lastly, we have "Talking". Do not
attack any enemies, but speak
or sing to them to break their will.
Your aim will be to wear them down
and get them to retreat.

You have not been trained, so the
instructions you will receive are
simple and few. You will receive
further orders on the field. That is
all.

Get on my level
	by The Chosen One(?)

Just how many - or how few - of you
can Perceive it? The Aura that glows
at people's feet. This Aura is what
I call...

The Gauge.

Being so Special in my Ability to
Perceive it has long tormented me.
But it is actually not very
difficult to Perceive, for all you
need to do is to... look. When
Emotions run high in combat, watch.
Watch as the Aura grows and reaches
its Peak. The converse is also true -
by reining in the Emotions, the
Gauge can be suppressed.

At its Peak, the Gauge will gleam
with a pearlescent radiance. By
pouring your very Soul into your
Techniques and focusing every Fibre
of your Being, you can Manifest your
Will into The One Strike That Will
Fell The Enemy.

...Which is to say that you can
pull off an extra-strong attack when
it's white.

But that is not all there is to it, 
for the White Gauge is not the final 
stage. Beyond it is the Pale Green 
Gauge, which will allow the User to 
have control over Time itself.



You will eventually understand what 
I mean. That is, if you ever get on 
my level. And I shall be there
waiting.

Necromanual
	written by
	a bored necromancer

Chess has gotten boring.

Necromancy is also quickly becoming 
a forgotten art - and that will
not do - so perhaps I could teach
you, dear reader, a thing or two 
about it.

To start, place a piece of a monster 
into a coffin. Next, using a mana 
crystal, shape the body into the 
desired form with Alchemy. Finally, 
garnish generously with malice.

That's all there is, really, if all 
that you want is an army of mass-
produced undead. To make a true 
work of art, however, will require 
you to have a sophisticated taste, 
complete knowledge of necromancy, 
and years of experience. Choosing 
the perfect monster part to use is 
certainly not a task for beginners. 
The special nanomachines and 
bacteria you need are also rather 
hard to come by these days.

Just keep in mind that you can't 
make something big if you start 
from a low quality piece monster 
part. Stretching will only get you 
that far before it starts to 
collapse on itself.



Undead that you've made can be 
remodeled by the further addition 
of one monster part. How it's 
remodeled depends on what kind of 
part is added, so you may want to 
experiment with that. Don't worry, 
you can always remodel with a 
different part if it's not to your 
liking.

These undead don't have the 
capacity to think, and will tend to 
stand around until they receive 
explicit instructions from you. Be 
sure to tell them which humans they 
should be attacking. If they do 
defeat something, you can have good 
experience and a good time without 
even lifting a finger.

There is power in numbers. Create 
enough of them and you can 
immediately replace any that fall 
in combat. Results in an 
unrelenting horde that will 
mercilessly crush your enemies.

You could heal them at the cost 
of your own life, but that's 
probably not a good idea when 
you're up against something that 
single-handedly can take on your 
army of undead. In these cases, 
you might want to blow up them up 
instead. Watch adversaries get 
tossed about like a rag doll, 
explosion after explosion. Costly, 
yes, but you cannot put a price 
tag on fun.

That's about it. Now go try it 
for yourself. Shoo.

The secrets of the journal
	by a PRO journalist

I see you've gotten your hands on 
the latest fad that everybody's 
gotta have - the Autoscribing 
Journal. But have you been putting 
it to good use?

The journal doesn't just list the 
quests undertaken by you - it also 
has the difficulty of each one of 
them.

The level (Lv) indicated is that 
of the target monster's, buuuut 
you probably don't have to be 
of that level to defeat it. If 
you're armed to the teeth, you 
could manage with, eh, maybe 60% 
of the monster's level? Not all 
quests involve combat, so there's 
that too.

The journal also automagically 
keeps track of the number of times 
the holder has done something. 
Turn on Record in the Settings, 
and you'll be good to go.

It's also got an uplink to town 
informers, so you can also check 
up on what your colleagues are 
doing while on the go. Oh, and 
it also has your guild quotas and 
rankings.




So yeah, have a look at it when you 
forget where you're supposed to go 
or if you wanna see how you've been 
doing.

SOR110 Introduction to Sorcery
	Lecture 1 notes
	Eulderna Metropolitan University

Mana
=====
A primordial source of power 
omnipresent in the world, found in 
the ocean, in the atmosphere, and 
within the earth. Living organisms 
sequester mana, and it may also get 
passed between organisms through 
predation and other means. This is 
known as the mana cycle. Mana 
sequestered within an organism may 
not exceed its capacity for it; 
any excess is excreted to the 
environment.


Dead organisms do not retain mana. 
Upon death, mana previously 
contained within the organism will 
begin diffusing out and back into 
the environment.

As the main use of mana is to 
convert it to MP, many sorcerers 
use the terms MP and mana 
interchangeably.

Magic
======
A form of energy that mana is 
converted into that is required 
for performing sorcery. Without 
conversion, mana cannot be 
efficiently used for spells and 
can only be used for the most 
rudimentary of purposes.

The affinity of an entity for 
magic is also happens to be called 
Magic (sometimes also known as the 
Magic attribute) but this 
terminology is fairly new and came 
into popular use only about 100 
years ago.

MP
===
Magic points. Unit of measurement 
for amount of Magic energy.

Divine power
=============
Energy that gods require to use 
their powers. The current theory 
is that it is extracted from 
offerings of their faithful and 
combined with mana. It is similar 
in some ways to magic, but is 
otherwise a completely different 
form of energy. Sorcerers in our 
country have yet to discover how 
to harness this power.

As an analogy, if mana were water, 
then MP would be bottles of water, 
and divine power would be bottles 
of soda.

You dig mining?
	by Borzoi J. Hammer
	
Borzoi here. And when it comes to 
mining, I'm the BEST.

You dig mining? 'cuz I sure do. 
It trains constitution. You come 
across stuff. And best of all, if 
you got no path, you can just 
MAKE ONE.

And didja know that mining in 
different places will get you 
different stuff? Betcha didn't.

These Cave and Lake nefia are 
filled with ores, so you'll want 
to go to these places if you want 
to give stuff to the Gods of the 
Earth or Healin'. Or if that's not 
your thing, you could give 'em a 
little polish by tossing them in
a fusion pot and they'll fetch some 
good coin.

Forest nefia are full of food that 
you won't find anywhere else. 
Acorns never rot so you can keep 
some in your pockets at all times. 
Then there's valuable golden acorns 
too. Gold! Must've been hidden 
there by a squirrel or summat. You 
might even luck out and find a rare 
four leafed clover.

Fortress and Tower nefia are made 
of stone, so guess what you get 
when you mine there? Stone! Heard 
you can sculpt these with uh... 
"item fusion", but I don't 
understand these artsy kinda 
things. You'll also find safes 
that people hid in there a long 
time ago.

Nest nefia will have the remains
and eggs of whatever lived in
there. And a whole load of shit,
which you're gonna have to wade
through to find anything good.

People bury their dead in the 
walls of Cemeteries. Prolly just 
out of habit for those people 
used to stashing their stuff in 
walls. Dig around for offerings and 
coffins. Are you gonna get cursed 
for doing that, you ask? Pssh 
'course not. Waste not, want not.

Mines yield ores. But not regular
ores. Probably ran out of those.
Wouldn't have become a nefia if
they didn't, eh? There's lotsa
clay here for pottery and stuff.

Lesee... oh right. Towns. Mine 
there and you might come across 
the coins and gold bars that the 
folk have stashed away. After all, 
you can't store money in shelves, 
'cuz those would get stolen, 
shelves and everything. So walls 
are where them people hide them 
life savings.

So what are you waiting for? 
Start mining!

What's in a performance?
	by a nameless travelling performer

I'm going to jot down a couple of 
ways of completing Performing 
quests in here just so that I don't 
forget. I've heard people say that 
all you need to do is to keep 
performing to a person until he's 
satisfied or bored, but I'm just 
not Speedy enough for that. So.

PERFORMING: perform with an 
instrument of your choice. You 
might find one at the event grounds, 
but it might not be in the right 
place so it's best to bring one 
yourself. What instrument you use 
may determine whether patrons are 
satisfied with your Performance or 
not. If they are, they will 
shower you with gold and items. 
I've also heard fables of the 
legendary Stradivarius improving
the quality of items thrown at 
you...

ENSEMBLE: sing with your pets. 
It'll be good experience for them, 
and you don't need an instrument 
either. It's a group effort so it's 
easier to succeed than a regular 
solo Performance, and if you're 
skilled enough the items thrown 
will be of better quality too. But 
doing this takes quite a bit of 
time and stamina, so be sure not 
to waste an ensemble on a deserted 
area. It also means you won't score 
as many Points with the client if 
you're not quick enough.

PREACHING: spread the Word about 
your God and captivate people with 
a gilded tongue. Pets seem to gain 
experience from this. If people are 
satisfied with your preaching, 
they'll give you quite a fair amount 
of alms. Meaning gold. No items 
though. If you're so convincing 
that people convert to your faith, 
then those people are going to be 
even more satisfied.

FASCINATION DANCE: this one's 
quicker than Performing and 
satisfies people more easily, so 
it's great for scoring Points with 
the client. If you're Charismatic, 
then all the better. There's just 
a bit of a problem with this - 
people become too transfixed on
your gyrating hips to give you 
any money.

FIRE BREATHING: did the best I 
could while on fire, but nobody 
even bat an eye...

It's my dream to become a great 
performer and bring smiles to 
people's faces wherever I go, but 
so far it's only been bringing 
rocks. Thrown in my direction. And 
Mum's been telling me to come 
home...

Experimental Characterization of
	Dimensional Energy
	by Gavela et al.


Dimensional energy is a form of 
energy capable of trans-dimensional
interaction with objects, including
people. Its existence has long 
been theorized but has lacked 
definitive experimental evidence.

Here we present its 
characterization via Verde-Hermann
experiments with a novel 
dimensional warp unit. We also 
explore the potential 
ramifications and applications of
this technology.


To test Verde-Hermann's postulate
that measurement of dimensional
energy is difficult due to the
dampening of dimensional energy by
the inter-dimensional barrier, we 
perturbed the barrier with a
dimensional warp unit and 
conducted the first and second 
Verde-Hermann tests. The
observational unit used is 
outlined in Appendix 1.

From the data (Appendices 1 to 6),
we have determined that 
dimensional energy is weakened
by a factor of approximately 
0.0025% under normal circumstances.


In the second test, we determined
at a high confidence level that it
is likely that dimensional
energy strength is inversely 
proportional to dimensional 
warpage, conforming to Ariane's 
Laws of Energy. However, we also 
find that when two analogous 
objects A and B are moved such that 
they are in the same dimension, 
rapid dissipation of dimensional
energy occurs. Further experiments
are needed to elucidate the 
mechanism for this phenomenon.

As dimensional energy flows down 
the potential gradient, we find 
find that there is the possibility
that limitless energy can be 
harnessed if dimensions can be linked.

However, we urge caution in the 
long-term harnessing of dimensional 
energy as the effects on the
affected dimensions are yet 
unknown. Furthermore, even if the
harnessing power causes no direct 
effects, it may be deemed an act 
of aggression by inhabitants in 
the other dimension.

To conclude, further research is 
needed for determining how 
analogous existences are linked in
multi-dimensional space, and to 
study the mechanism for that
linkage to develop a practical 
trans-dimensional communications 
tool.

依頼についてのアドバイス
	written by 心配性の父

愛するわが子へ。
　お前が家出の準備を進めていることは知っ
ていました。荷物の底に父さんのなけなしの
お小遣いをこっそり入れておきます。それが
尽きる前に、街で依頼を受けて自分で生活費
を稼ぎなさい。
　依頼には色々な種類があります。




○物を手に入れてくる依頼
先に物を確保してから依頼を受けるのがコツ
です。
だいたい野外に落ちていたり、お店で売って
います。野外に行くなら野生動物と無理に戦
わないこと。
○人から物を手に入れてくる依頼
ガードさんに持ち主の居場所を尋ね、会って
自分の手持ちアイテムと交換できないか話し
てみましょう。
その人以外から手に入れても大丈夫なので、
先に野外で拾ったりお店で買っておくと安心。

○料理を用意する依頼
生活に苦労している段階で、食材を確保して
目当ての料理を作るのは困難です。
料理を確保できてから依頼を受けること。
運がよければお店で売っていることもあるで
しょう。

○作物を収穫する依頼
野生動物がうじゃうじゃいるので、あしらえ
るようになってから挑んでください。
作物を引き抜く際にちょっと身体も鍛えられ
ます。
ノルマの数倍のスコアを出せば報酬が増えた
りブロンズ硬貨ももらえたりしますが、最初
は難しいでしょうね。
納入箱の位置が分からなくなったら、慌てず
に*キーで探すこと。

○モンスター退治の依頼
他の依頼でお金を貯めて、全身にましな防具
を装備してから挑みましょう。
ペットを連れていくのならペットにも防具を
渡してあげてください。iキーです。
さもなければ返り討ちにされます。難易度が
一番低いやつでも、です。

○物を配達する依頼
別の街に行かなくてはならないので、食糧や
戦力が安定して、街の位置関係も把握できて
からにしましょう。
届ける相手は届け先の街のガードさんが教え
てくれます。もし期間内に届けられなかった
場合、横領の罪になってしまいます。
○人を護衛する依頼
こちらも別の街に行くことになります。護衛
対象が死ぬと失敗。稼ぎやすいので近場かつ
安全な種類ならば、悪くない賭けです。

○穴や地雷を撤去する依頼
罠の知識のスキルがないと体力が持ちません。
他には、物質を感知できる魔法やアイテムが
鍵を握っています。

○芸を披露する依頼
演奏や説法、舞などの芸ができないと厳しい
です。レベルの高い人に下手な芸を見せると
殺されるので、芸ができても最初は乞食や老
人が集まっているところでやりましょう。

　父さんが知っているのはここまでです。
ヴェルニースの南にある施設では色々な講座
をやっているらしいので、依頼でお金を稼い
だら早めに行ってみてはどうでしょうか。

　しかしプチを飼うのに反対されたからって
母さんとあんな大喧嘩しなくてもよかったで

Quest Advice
	by Worried dad

Son,
    I know you've been planning to 
leave. I've managed to scrounge up 
some money - you can find it at the
bottom of your belongings. It 
should tide you over until you can 
establish an income from taking 
quests in towns.

    You should know that there are 
several types of quests though:

- Item requests
    The key to these is to have the 
item before taking on the quest. 
They often ask for stuff that can be 
found lying around in the 
wilderness or in shops.
When going out to the wilderness, 
you don't have to fight every wild 
animal you come across.

- Belongings requests
    Ask a guard where you can find 
the person who has the requested 
item. Then talk to that guy, and 
exchange some of your items for it. 
Or, you can get it from just about 
anywhere - from the wilderness or
shops - the quest giver won't know 
the difference.

- Cooked dish requests
    It's going to be hard to have 
ingredients to cook the dishes they 
want when you don't even have 
enough to eat yourself. Take on
these quests when you're not 
struggling. If you're lucky, you 
might find the ingredient you need 
in a shop in town.

- Harvesting requests
    These are filled with wild 
animals, so you'll need to be able 
to fend them off at the very least. 
These are decent for training 
because you'll be pulling up lots 
of crops from the ground.
Exceed quota by several times and 
they'll pay you more. They might 
even give you a bronze coin too.
But going over is going to be hard 
when you're just starting off.
If you forget where the delivery 
chest is, don't panic - just look 
around with the * key.
- Monster slaying requests
    Before taking these on, make 
sure you are fully equipped with
decent armour. If you have a pet, 
make sure they are equipped as well 
by handing them equipment while 
'i'nteracting with them (using the 
'i' key). If you don't, these WILL
kill you. Yes, even the easiest ones.

- Item delivery requests
    You'll need to go to another 
town to complete these. Have enough 
food and be combat ready. Know  
where you are and where you're going.
In the destination town, you can 
ask guards where the delivery 
recipient is. If you don't deliver
in time, they'll accuse you of 
pocketing the item.
- Escort requests
    This one will also need you to 
go to another town. If the escorted 
target dies, the quest is failed. 
These can be profitable if it's 
only a short jog to the destination 
and the client isn't in any sort of 
danger.

- Hole and mine removal requests
    You won't last without the 
Disarm Trap skill. Either that or 
spells or items that allow you to 
Sense or Detect Objects.

- Performing requests
    These are hard if you can't 
perform, preach, or dance. If a 
high level person sees you messing 
up, he might kill you. So even if 
you can perform, be sure to perform 
only to beggars and old people 
until you get proficient at it.




    That's about all that I know. 
There's a cram school south of Vernis
where you can attend some seminars 
to learn more, so you might want
to go there when you have some 
money to spare after finishing some
quests.

    It really didn't have to come 
to this - the quarrel with Mom 
about getting a pet putit and 
everything.

    If you don't manage, please
don't be stubborn - come home.
Given how headstrong you are,
you'd probably rather resort to 
begging on the streets, but know 
that I'm worried about you. Do be 
careful out there, and watch your 
back. There are plenty of people 
out there who thrive on preying on 
others.

    And also know that whatever
you are, I - and your mother
as well - hope that you are
happy.

Love,
your dad

釣り入門
	written by 釣り自慢のフィッシャー

　釣りは時間調整のついでに魚が手に入る！
魚は食べても売ってもオイシイ！どうだい、
釣りを始めたくなってきただろう？
　まず必要なのは釣りスキルだ。持っていな
ければヴェルニースのトレイナーに教えても
らうんだな。

　スキルを用意したら、釣りに必要な釣竿と
釣り餌を買ってくるんだ。餌は最初のうちは
ミジンコが最適だろう。B(shift+b)で、餌を
釣り竿に装着するんだ。餌1個で15〜24回分
くらいだ。

　高い餌を使っても、スキルが低いと上手く
釣れないからな。目安としては、釣りスキル
が10上がるたびにひとつ上の餌に変えていく
くらいでいいんじゃないかな。ガラクタしか
釣れない場合は、餌に対してスキルが足りて
いないってことだ。ガラクタは使い道が特に
ないぞ。

　同じ魚でも、大きさが違えば重さや価値が
違ってくる。なるべく大物を釣り上げたいが、
こればっかりは運だな。そのままだと８時間
くらいで腐ってしまうから、こまめに料理す
るかクーラーボックス等に保管しよう。どう
しても持ちきれない場合は、水中に置いてお
けば腐らないぞ。

　さて…釣った魚には実は餌をやることがで
きる。俺は合成の壺で撒き餌を作って与えて
いるよ。餌をやると魚の質が良くなるし、稀
にだが、アイテムを吐き出したりするんだ。
釣った魚に餌をやらないタイプは、このこと
を知らないんだろうなぁ。

Fishing Introduction
	by A proud fisherman

Kill time, get fish!
Two birds, one stone!
Do I have you hooked?
If so, read on!

First you'll need the Fishing
skill. Don't have it? Learn it
from the trainer in Vernis!

Next, you'll need to buy some
fishing rod and bait. Water flea
is best for beginners. 'B'lend  
(Shift + b key) one to attach it to 
your rod. One water flea is good 
for 15-24 uses.


The pricier and better baits won't 
work if your Fishing skill isn't up 
to snuff. Generally, you can switch 
to a better bait every 10 skill 
levels. If all you're reeling in is 
junk, that means you don't have 
enough skill to use that bait yet. 
And junk is... junk! There's no use 
for it.

As for the fish - the amount 
they'll fetch when sold depends on
their size and weight. There's no 
choosing the size of fish that bite 
though. It's all up to Lady Ehekatl!

Fish will also go bad in about
8 hours, so you'll want to cook 
them and cook often. Or you can 
carry them around in a cooler box. 
If you've got more fish than you 
can carry (wow!), pop them in a 
puddle on the ground. They won't go 
bad that way, ever!

Speaking of those fish in a puddle...
you can do some tricks with them.
I like to give mine ground bait, 
crafted in a fusion pot. Fish will 
grow in quality when you do, and
they might even spit out a useful 
item or two for you! If you're the 
sort who never feeds their fishies, 
you're missing out!
